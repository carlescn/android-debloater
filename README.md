# Android ~~debloater~~ package manager

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project on which I'm working on my free time,
without any consistency or schedule.
It is mainly an excuse to learn how to build a somewhat complex application with a user interface in Python.
I would like to test different UI libraries,
for now I'm learning the basics of Tkinter.


## Roadmap

**For now,
this is only a simple package manager for Android.**

Once the package manager part is fully functional,
I want to create some kind of database of package ids,
categorizing them as known to be secure, insecure, bloatware, etc.
I'm still thinking on ways to do it...

Finally,
I want to add the functionality to easily remove all insecure / bloatware / whatever apps,
thus the name of the repository.


## Contribution

As mentioned above, this is a personal project for learning purposes.
Feel free to fork it, reuse some code or contribute in any way you see fit.
But keep in mind I don't intend for this to be an actively maintained project
(at least for now).
